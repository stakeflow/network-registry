# Network Registry Instruction   

## Description
These are simple instructions for adding your validator data to the [Network Registry](https://github.com/stakeflow/network-registry) repo.

## Getting Started
Firstly you need to fork the registry [repo](https://github.com/stakeflow/network-registry), clone it locally and open by your favorite editor.

#### Step 1: Select the folder with the name of the blockchain to which you want to add your data.

#### Step 2: In the selected folder create a folder named according to your validator address.

#### Step 3: In your validator folder you need to add two files: `logo.png` & `validator-details.json`.

#### Step 4: Create a pull-request containing your updated data.

#### Note: You can see an example of filling the validator data for Autonity Piccadilly testnet [here](https://github.com/stakeflow/network-registry/tree/main/autonity-piccadilly-testnet/validators/0xf6709934bADDDf7Dd79eED134A875984597E8148).
